# null-gui
gui framework

Created only by the fact that there was nothing more to do and the idea of making your own gui was brewing for a long time.
Perhaps, if someone wants to make their own gui, they can pick something up for their project (although most of the code is blueprint with ImGui).
Warning! The code has a huge amount of shit and other garbage that someday, perhaps, will be fixed.
